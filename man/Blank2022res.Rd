\description{
Object of class MALDIcellassay from MALDI mass spectrometry data of EOC cells treated with different concentrations of SAHA.
It is used to demonstrate the usage of \code{MALDIcellassay}.
}
\details{
The concentrations include: 0, 0.04, 0.12, 0.37, 1.11, 3.33, 10 and 30 uM of SAHA at 4 replicates each.
The original spectra were trimmed to 400-900 Da mass-range to keep the file size small.
The peaks are the result of
\code{fitCurve(spec = Blank2022spec, SinglePointRecal = TRUE,  normMz = 760.585,  alignTol = 0.1,  normTol = 0.1)}
